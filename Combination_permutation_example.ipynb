        "Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics which is about counting – and we will discover many exciting examples of “things” you can count.\n",
        "First combinatorial problems have been studied by ancient Indian, Arabian and Greek mathematicians. Interest in the subject increased during the 19th and 20th century, together with the development of graph theory and problems like the four colour theorem. Some of the leading mathematicians include Blaise Pascal (1623 – 1662), Jacob Bernoulli (1654 – 1705) and Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783).\n",
        "Combinatorics has many applications in other areas of mathematics, including graph theory, coding and cryptography, and probability.\n",

        "In mathematics, permutation is the act of arranging the members of a set into a sequence or order, or, if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements—a process called permuting. Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. \n",
        "\n",
        "Permutations are studied in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In computer science, they are used for analyzing sorting algorithms; in quantum physics, for describing states of particles, and in biology, for describing RNA sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial, usually written as n!, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n",
